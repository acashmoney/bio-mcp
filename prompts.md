# Test Prompts for PDB-MCP Hackathon Project

## For the analyze-active-site Tool

### Basic Functionality Tests
- "What can you tell me about the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease? Look at PDB ID 6LU7."
- "Analyze the binding pocket of HIV protease (PDB: 1HSG)."
- "I'm studying lysozyme. Can you examine its active site structure? The PDB ID is 1LYZ."
- "What residues are important in the catalytic site of trypsin (PDB: 1PPH)?"
- "Describe the active site of acetylcholinesterase (PDB: 1EVE)."

### Disease-Specific Queries
- "I'm researching Alzheimer's disease. Can you analyze the structure of beta-amyloid (PDB: 2BEG)?"
- "For my cancer research, I need information about the binding site of EGFR (PDB: 1M17)."
- "What does the active site of influenza neuraminidase look like? Check PDB: 2HU4."
- "I'm studying diabetes. Can you analyze insulin receptor structure (PDB: 1IR3)?"
- "For my Parkinson's research, what can you tell me about alpha-synuclein structure (PDB: 1XQ8)?"

### Structure-Function Relationships
- "How does the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (6LU7) compare to the original SARS virus protease?"
- "What makes the binding pocket of HIV protease (1HSG) a good drug target?"
- "What residues in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (PDB: 6M17) interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein?"

## For the search-disease-proteins Tool

### Common Diseases
- "What proteins are associated with Alzheimer's disease?"
- "Find proteins related to diabetes."
- "Search for cancer-related protein structures."
- "Which proteins are involved in heart disease?"
- "Find protein structures related to Parkinson's disease."

### Emerging/Specific Disease Areas
- "What protein structures are associated with COVID-19?"
- "Find proteins related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."
- "Search for protein structures involved in autoimmune disorders."
- "Which proteins are implicated in cystic fibrosis?"
- "Find structures related to multiple sclerosis."

### Specific Protein Types
- "What kinase structures are associated with cancer?"
- "Find proteases involved in viral infections."
- "Search for receptor proteins linked to neurological disorders."
- "Which ion channel structures are related to heart conditions?"

### Multi-Step Analysis Scenarios
- "I'm researching COVID-19 treatments. First, find proteins related to COVID-19, then analyze the active site of the main protease."
- "For my Alzheimer's research, find relevant proteins and then analyze the structure of beta-amyloid."
- "I'm studying diabetes. Find insulin-related proteins and then analyze the binding site of the most relevant structure."

### Educational Queries
- "I'm a biology student learning about enzyme structure. Can you show me how to analyze the active site of chymotrypsin (PDB: 1YPH)?"
- "For my biochemistry class, I need to understand protein-drug interactions. Can you find HIV-related proteins and explain their binding sites?"
- "I'm teaching a class on structural biology. Can you help me find a good example of a disease-related protein with an interesting active site?"
